This plugin allows you to output the RDS text from a playlist media file to a message queue.

The message queue file can be stored on a shared network device or stored locally.

If you want to have the Matrix data displayed on a remote matrix, install the Matrix Mesage Plugin, the Message Queue Plugin and the rdsToMatrix
plugin on the remote device that has the matrix connected to it.

Configure the Matrix Message Plugin to output to the Matrix you have defined
Configure the Matrix Message plugin to output the data from the rdsToMatrix plugin as defined in the subscription box
Configure the Message Queue plugin to point to the file that is shared. This is important as the rdsToMatrix (or other plugins)
will be writing to this file and various plugins will read from this file

Enable the plugin
Enable the messageQueue plugin
Enable the MatrixMessage Plugin

Restart FPPD

Enjoy your text to your matrix!

If you want to send the data to a remote instance of the EDM rds plugin then you need to make a soft link in the 
/home/fpp/media/scripts directory to the rds-song.py file located in /home/fpp/media/plugins/edmrds

you do this by typing

cd /home/fpp/media/scripts
ln -s /home/fpp/media/scripts/edmrds/rds-song.py
